# Minimax Tree
* [x] = Minimax Agent - Figuring out how to create a sub game for tree analyis
* [x] = Minimax Agent - How to get the score value : It is just state.score()
* [x] = Minimax Agent - Create optimal datastructre giving next tree state to node.
* [x] = Minimax Agent - Run at depth of 1. max
* [x] = Minimax Agent - run at depth of 2 min 
* [x] = Minimax Agent - run at multiple depths
